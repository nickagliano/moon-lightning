# Moon Lightning
Meant to be a landing page / promo for a science fiction short that I'm currently working on.

## Project highlights
- Three.js
- ES6 with polyfill for async/await
- Webpack
- Dev server with hot-module-reloading


### Lightning
- Procedurally generated
- Uses an [L-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) algorithm to build the fractal-like/self-similar properties of lightning
- Inspired by [this blog post from 2009](http://drilian.com/2009/02/25/lightning-bolts/)

### Moon
- Texture downloaded from [NASA](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=4720)

# If you want to run it yourself...

- [Prerequsite] Have node and npm installed (I use asdf to manage versions, you can check the `.tool-versions` file to see the current version I'm running)
- `git clone https://github.com/nickagliano/moon-lightning.git`
- `cd moon-lightning`
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
